## Resolve the CLI for this session

Choose the executable once and reuse it for every later command:

- Use `hive` in current production builds.
- If the compatibility environment variable `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` is set, use its value instead;
  HiveCode exports it when a managed session must pin a specific executable.
- Older development, Linux, or production installs may expose `orca-dev`, `orca-ide`, or
  `orca`. Treat these as compatibility aliases and use one only when `hive` is unavailable.
  On unmanaged Linux, never try bare `orca` first because it normally resolves to the
  GNOME Orca screen reader (`/usr/bin/orca`) and starts speech on the user's machine.

Examples use the current `hive` command. Substitute the pinned executable or a legacy alias
only when the active HiveCode build requires it. If that executable cannot run, report its
exact error and stop; do not fall through to another executable that may target a different
HiveCode build.

The same executable selection works in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

<!-- block: no-guessing -->

Prefer `--json`. Use the selected executable's `--help` for commands or flags the guide does
not cover. If HiveCode is not running, start it with `hive open --json` and retry.
If it fails with `runtime_access_denied`, the sandbox blocked the connection:
retry with the required access and do not restart HiveCode. If `skills get` is
unknown, explain that updating HiveCode restores the guide; use `--help` for
read-only discovery and the bounded fallback below instead of guessing flags.
